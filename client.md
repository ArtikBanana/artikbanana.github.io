### Client
You will start by installing the game with the old installer, then overwrite some WZ files with our custom ones, and lastly get the localhost executable in place.  
_You can also directly download the folder with all of the files, ready for use from the [Release](https://github.com/ArtikBanana/artikbanana.github.io/releases/download/v0.0.1/MapleStoryFolder.7z)._

#### Steps

1. Download _MapleGlobal-v83-setup.exe_ from the [Release](https://github.com/ArtikBanana/artikbanana.github.io/releases/download/v0.0.1/MapleGlobal-v83-setup.exe). This is the official installer from back then.
2. Install it in a directory of your choice.
3. Delete the following files from the installation directory: _HShield_ (entire directory), _ASPLnchr.exe_, _MapleStory.exe_, and _Patcher.exe_.
4. Download _CosmicWZ-2024-07-17-v0.14.0.zip_ from the [Release](https://github.com/ArtikBanana/artikbanana.github.io/releases/download/v0.0.1/CosmicWZ_2024-07-17_v0.14.0.zip).
5. Unzip it and copy all .wz-files into the installation directory. Replace the existing ones.
6. Download _HeavenMS-localhost-WINDOW.exe_ from the [Release](https://github.com/ArtikBanana/artikbanana.github.io/releases/download/v0.0.1/HeavenMS-localhost-WINDOW.exe). This is a client modified to connect to your localhost instead of Nexon's server (along with some fixes and custom changes). 
   - Your antivirus will likely detect the file as a trojan or similar and automatically delete it. To prevent this from happening, add your _Downloads_ directory and the installation directory as exclusions in your antivirus software. On W11, this is under "Virus & threat protection settings" -> "Add or remove exclusions". 
7. Move _HeavenMS-localhost-WINDOW.exe_ into the installation directory.
8. Done! Double-click the exe and the game should start.
   - The client may be a bit fiddly. Sometimes it won't start, but if you see "Client connected" in the server console it's a good indication. Try spam-clicking it like 10+ times, that usually works for me.
   - _Or set compatibility to Windows XP_

**Important note about localhost clients**: these executables are red-flagged by antivirus tools as potentially malicious software.
This happens due to the reverse engineering methods that were applied onto these software artifacts. 
The one provided here has been in use for years already and posed no harm so far, so it is assumed to be safe.

### Getting into the game
The client has started, and you're looking at the login screen. 

#### Logging in
At this point, you can log in to the admin account using the following credentials:
* Username: "admin"
* Password: "admin"
* Pin: "0000"
* Pic: "000000"

Or create a regular account by typing in your desired username & password and attempting to log in. This "automatic registration" feature lets you create new accounts to play around with. It is enabled by default.
